You can move around the scene using keyboard "WSAD" keys and mouse. To enable mouse cursor press "G". Pressing "G" again changes back to looking around mode.
To close window press escape.

You can change parameters using sliders in upper left corners. (sometimes if your window loses focus it is no longer possible).
